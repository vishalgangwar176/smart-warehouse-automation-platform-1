## 1. Overview

```
Warehouse Task = Simulated OS Process
```

Each warehouse task (picking, packing, urgent orders, etc.) is treated as a process with arrival time, burst time and priority. The platform schedules these tasks on a simulated CPU, protects shared data with synchronization primitives, and handles deadlocks over shared warehouse resources.

**What this project is not:** it does **not** control physical robots, workers, IoT hardware or real warehouse machinery. Only *shared resources* (packing stations, label printers, dispatch bays) are modelled for deadlock handling — robots and workers are never treated as processes.

The project is extended review by review, and **earlier modules are kept unchanged**; new concepts are added as extensions.

## 3. Features

### Review 1: Priority scheduling baseline
- Warehouse tasks as processes with a simplified **Process Control Block (PCB)** and states `NEW → READY → RUNNING → TERMINATED`
- Priority-ordered **ready queue** with FCFS tie-breaking
- Single-core **simulated CPU** and short-term scheduler
- **Non-Pre-emptive** and **Pre-emptive** Priority Scheduling
- Metrics: Completion Time, Turnaround Time, Waiting Time, Response Time, and their averages
- Event logs and terminal-rendered **ASCII Gantt charts**

### Review 2: Scheduling extensions
| Scheduler | How it works in the warehouse |
|---|---|
| **Round Robin** | Fixed, **configurable time quantum**; an unfinished task returns to the back of the queue |
| **Multilevel Queue (MLQ)** | Urgent queue → Pre-emptive Priority; Normal queue → Round Robin; Routine queue → FCFS. Higher queues are served first |
| **Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ)** | Tasks start at the top level, drop a level after using a full quantum, and are promoted by **aging** if they wait too long |

The quantum is configurable on purpose: a very small value causes many context switches, and a very large one behaves like FCFS. All new schedulers use the same task record as Review 1.

### Review 2: Threads
- Sub-activities of a task (stock check, picking list, dispatch document) are modelled as **threads** that share the task's data, mapped to thread states
- Studied: process vs thread, benefits, thread types, multithreading models (hyper-threading studied as a concept only)

### Review 2: Process synchronization
- **Race condition demonstration:** two tasks updating one inventory count can lose an update
- **Critical section** guarded by a **binary semaphore** (mutual exclusion) for the shared inventory update
- **Bounded Buffer (producer–consumer):** an order buffer between intake and picking, using counting semaphores for empty and full slots
- Lock variables and strict alternation were rejected: a lock variable does not guarantee mutual exclusion, and strict alternation can block a task
- Studied as models: Dining Philosophers, Sleeping Barber; Readers-Writers applied

### Review 2: Deadlock handling
- Checks the four conditions: mutual exclusion, hold and wait, no pre-emption, circular wait
- **Prevention:** fixed resource request order
- **Avoidance:** **Banker's Algorithm** safety check; a request is granted only in a safe state
- **Detection and recovery:** circular waits are reported; recovery ends or restarts a task to release its resources

## 4. Priority Mapping & Task Types

Priority scale: **1 = Urgent (highest), 2 = Normal, 3 = Routine (lower)**.

| Warehouse Task | Priority | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Urgent Order Processing | 1 | Express shipments needing immediate fulfilment |
| Normal Order Processing | 2 | Standard customer orders |
| Picking | 2 | Item retrieval from storage bins |
| Packing | 2 | Boxing and sealing picked goods |
| Dispatch Preparation | 2 | Manifesting and staging goods at loading docks |
| Inventory Update | 3 | Periodic stock reconciliation |
| Restocking | 3 | Replenishing shelves from bulk receiving |

## 6. How to Run

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.8+ (standard library only, no external packages).

```bash
# Run automated tests
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py" -v

# Run all demonstrations
python main.py --demo

# Run individual test cases
python main.py --case1   # Urgent order pre-emption
python main.py --case2   # 4-process comparative benchmark
python main.py --case3   # Full 7-task warehouse workload
```

On Windows you can also double-click `run_simulation.bat` or run `.\run_simulation.bat` in PowerShell.

For the web front end, open `index.html` in a browser.

## 7. Sample Results (Review 1 baseline)

These come from the Priority Scheduling baseline, which Review 2 keeps unchanged.

### Test Case 1: Urgent order pre-empts routine restocking

| PID | Task | Priority | AT | BT |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | Restocking | 3 | 0 | 8 |
| P2 | Urgent Order Processing | 1 | 2 | 3 |

```
Pre-emptive Gantt:
+--------+---------+------------------+
|   P1   |    P2   |        P1        |
+--------+---------+------------------+
0        2         5                 11
```

| Metric | Non-Pre-emptive | Pre-emptive |
|---|---|---|
| Avg Turnaround Time | 8.50 | **7.00** |
| Avg Waiting Time | 3.00 | **1.50** |
| Avg Response Time | 3.00 | **0.00** |

### Test Case 2: Staggered 4-process benchmark

| Metric | Non-Pre-emptive | Pre-emptive |
|---|---|---|
| Avg Turnaround Time | 8.50 | **8.00** |
| Avg Waiting Time | 4.75 | **4.25** |
| Avg Response Time | 4.75 | **3.75** |

### Test Case 3: Full 7-task workload

| Metric | Non-Pre-emptive | Pre-emptive |
|---|---|---|
| Avg Turnaround Time | 10.71 | **10.00** |
| Avg Waiting Time | 7.43 | **6.71** |
| Avg Response Time | 7.43 | **4.29** |

### Review 2 outcomes

The same task set can now be scheduled with **five methods**: Non-Pre-emptive Priority, Pre-emptive Priority, Round Robin, Multilevel Queue and Multilevel Feedback Queue.

- Round Robin and MLFQ bound the waiting time of routine tasks, reducing **starvation**, at the cost of more context switches.
- The semaphore keeps the shared inventory count consistent.
- Unsafe resource requests are held back by Banker's Algorithm, and circular waits are reported.

Full numerical comparisons across all five schedulers will be consolidated in the final report.

## 8. Case Studies

- **RTOS scheduling:** priority-driven pre-emptive scheduling (Liu & Layland)
- **Database deadlock avoidance:** applied to shared-resource deadlock handling

## 9. Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|---|---|
| Choosing a time quantum | Made it configurable and tested more than one value |
| Keeping Review 1 modules working | Added new schedulers separately and re-ran Review 1 tests |
| Modelling deadlock without treating robots or workers as processes | Modelled only shared resources (packing stations, label printers, dispatch bays) |
